## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing data related to police killings in the United States. It involves cleaning, exploring, and visualizing the data using various Python libraries and tools. The goal is to gain insights into the patterns and factors associated with police killings.

## Skills and Tools Used

To complete this project, the following skills and tools were utilized:

1. **Python**: Python programming language was used as the primary tool for data analysis and visualization.

2. **NumPy**: NumPy was used for numerical operations and data manipulation.

3. **Pandas**: The Pandas library was crucial for data manipulation, cleaning, and organization.

4. **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib was used for creating static data visualizations.

5. **Seaborn**: Seaborn was used for creating statistical data visualizations with a high-level interface.

6. **Plotly Express**: Plotly Express was used for creating interactive and visually appealing data visualizations.

7. **Jupyter Notebook**: The project was developed and documented in a Jupyter Notebook, enabling interactive data exploration and visualization.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

The initial dataset contained information about police killings, including demographic data such as race, age, and gender. The data required cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and format issues.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted to understand the dataset better. This included:

- Visualizing the distribution of police killings by race, age, and gender.
- Calculating the average age of individuals killed by police.
- Identifying the most common manner of death.
- Analyzing the presence of mental illness among individuals killed by police.

## Data Visualization

Data was visualized using various chart types, including bar plots, histograms, and interactive maps. Key visualizations included:

1. **Bar Charts**: Bar charts were used to display the count of police killings by race and manner of death.

2. **Histograms**: Histograms were utilized to visualize the age distribution of individuals killed by police.

3. **Choropleth Maps**: Interactive choropleth maps were created to visualize the number of police killings by US state.

4. **Line Charts**: Line charts were used to show trends in daily police killings, with a rolling average applied to smooth the data.

## Rate of Death by Race

The project also involved calculating the death rate by race in the top 10 cities. This analysis compared the share of each race in these cities with the number of deaths for each race to determine if there were disparities in the death rates.

## Conclusion

This data analysis project provided insights into police killings in the United States. It highlighted patterns and disparities related to race, age, and other demographic factors. The use of Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly Express facilitated data analysis and visualization.
